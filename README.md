Starting:

Use NPM: https://www.npmjs.com it comes with Node.JS https://nodejs.org/en/

```
npm install
npm start
```

Why like that?

- I want typescript, which is a superset of javascript.
- I want modules, so that I don't have to import files in html

What changes?

- Typescript instead of Javascript, which adds nothing, just types

That's it
